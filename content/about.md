GitGuild was founded by Ira Miller with the goal of organizing and monitization of Open Source development.

Traditionally, monitization of Open Source has been done using a corporate model, which tends to be expensive, slow, and inefficient. Often, under this corporate model, the founding principles of a software project are lost.

As an expert in the fields of cryptographic implements such as [Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) and [Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page), Ira recognized opportunities in utilizing these new paradigms to allow individuals leading open source projects to focus on code quality. While still allowing an opportunity for decentralized monitization.

Examples of how these technologies are leveraged include payments made to escrow in bitcoin or cryptocurrency. And PGP is the basis for workflow and cryptographic signatures.

Under GitGuild's governance model, freely associating individuals can work together and profit while enabling transparency, accountability, and quality control.
