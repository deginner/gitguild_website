Monitized high quality open source development is the primary motivator for Git Guild and peer review are a foundational aspect of the scientific method. 

Computer scientists are arguably the most meticulous professionals around maintaining and tracking each and every contribution. Specifically, version control systems such as Git, support near perfect accounting of contributions to documents of a wide variety of formats.

As there are already tens of millions of open source developers, arguably representing billions of USD worth of value, this is a huge sector going untapped and undeveloped. Thankfully, Git aleady provides provable, perfectly documented and sometimes even cryptographically signed records of all contributions to each of these projects.

Git Guild combines these documented, signed git contributions with Bitcoin as a reserve currency to create a structured, community driven and funded framework for development.

Participants simply need to document the task or contract in a guild-approved format, deposit Bitcoin as payment, and issue a pull request meeting guild standards. A peer review will be required to for developers, reviewers, and other parties to retrieve the payment.
